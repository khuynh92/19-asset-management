 PORT = 3000

 ``` 

 3. First start up your mongo server, and then in your terminal, locate where you cloned this repository, and then type the command: `npm start`. This will begin the server.

 4. in your broswer go to  
`http://localhost:<YOURPORTHERE>`  

 5. Here, you can input fields to test the POST request. The post request will direct you to `http://localhost:<YOURPORTHERE>/post` and show the generated JSON Web Token (jwt) from the post

 6. To test signup(post), use your choice of tools that makes requests to servers (httpie, postman). Without a header that has Basic Authorization, a 401 will be sent. if There is a header object with a Basic Authorizatoin Key, a status code of 200 will be returned with the jwt.

 7. to test the signin(get), ensure that you are signing in using a basic authentication created using the id and password from an existing user

### API Testing api/v1/pizza
*All tests must have a bearer authentication from an existing user in the database*
